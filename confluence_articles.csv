3711140012,Account Breached/Compromised Process,"Support receives queries where the customers report that their accounts are
breached.  
  
**Below are the two different types of scenarios:**

  1. **SMS Pumping Issue**

  2. **Account Compromised**  

**How to understand which type of issue is it?**

  1. **In the case of SMS pumping, there is typically a sudden increase in SMS traffic, particularly OTP (One-Time Password) or ARN (Authorization Code) traffic. Despite the increase in volume, the traffic profile remains consistent, with the same content being sent repeatedly.**

  2. **On the other hand, in instances of compromised authentication IDs or tokens, random traffic starts to appear. This traffic is not consistent and may vary in content.**

**Checklist**

  * We should pull out the MDRs / CDRs for the mentioned period (the timespan of the breach).

  * Analyze the traffic triggered from the account by viewing the message content.

  * If the traffic triggered is in line with their usual message content, then it is the issue of SMS pumping.

3711140211,Outbound Message Delivery Issues,"This document explains most of the possible causes of SMS delivery issues for
outbound messages that are reported by customers and how to resolve them.

Outbound Debugging Flowchart

# Basic Checks:

Before moving into the depth of any investigation, we need to do the basic
checks at our end:

  1. Check the account type of the customer. Whether it is a Developer (free trial) or a Standard account. _Link_

  2. Check if the customer has enough credits in his account. _Link_

  3. Check the _Plivo Status Page_ for any outage updated at our end or the carrier's end on that day and also match the timestamps of the reported issue. 

  4. Check the Plivo error code and carrier error code. 

  5. Check the customer's statistics if he has reported SMS delivery issues towards a particular country or number, in order to find out patterns. We can also try checking if this issue is occurring for multiple customers or a single customer. 

  6. Check if the customer is sending an SMS to a valid destination number. 

  7. Check if the customer is abiding by the country's regulations for the destination country. 

# Message States:

When an outbound message is triggered, the customers get to see the messages
usually in 5 states.

  1. **Queued** : All outbound messages are initially 'Queued' which means that Plivo has 'accepted' the message from a user and will attempt to send the message to the respective downstream carrier for delivery.

  2. **Failed** : This status is updated when Plivo is unable to submit the message to the carrier. This is usually due to an internal error at Plivo's end. 

  3. **Sent** : A message is marked as ""Sent"" when the message is successfully passed on to the carrier for delivery. 

  4. **Delivered** : The message is delivered to the end-user (destination number).

  5. **Undelivered** : The message is marked as ""Undelivered"" depending on the delivery receipt received from the carrier. 

note

The customers are only charged for the messages which the message was sent to
the carrier for delivery, ie, Sent, Delivered, and Undelivered. The customers
are not charged for messages that are in the 'Failed' state.

The customers are only charged for the messages which the message was sent to
the carrier for delivery, ie, Sent, Delivered, and Undelivered. The customers
are not charged for messages that are in the 'Failed' state.

In order to investigate any SMS outbound delivery issue, we would need samples
(Message UUIDs) to review the issue that has been reported by our customers.
Few customers do provide us with the specific message UUIDs in the tickets but
few do not. For the customers who do not provide us with the message UUIDs, we
can try to figure out a few specific message UUIDs by fetching their MDRs. For
example, if a customer has reported ""_Few of our messages are being delivered
with a delay of 5 mins since yesterday_ "". In this case, we can fetch his MDRs
for yesterday, filter them by 'delivered', and see the number of samples that
show up. If the number of samples is less (like 10-30), we can compare the
delivery DATE column and the DELIVERY TIME column and check for the messages
that faced the delay. If the number of messages is huge, then we can reach out
to the customer asking for specific samples. Another example is if the
customer says ""Many of our messages are being marked as delivered but our
users do not receive them."" In this case, we would need to reach out to the
customer for the specific message UUIDs as we would be unable to figure out
the specific Message UUIDs that were not delivered (fake delivery).

The SMS outbound delivery issues can be broadly classified as per the delivery
statuses:

  1. Issues occurring for **delivered samples**.

  2. Issues occurring for **undelivered samples**.

  3. Issues occurring for **failed samples**.

  4. Issues occurring for samples stuck in the **sent state**. 

# Under Delivered Samples:

## 1\. SMS Delayed:

### a. Delay from Plivo/Customer:

We need to check the difference between the queued and the sent message time
and see if there is a delay in the message being sent from our platform after
it was in the queued state.

**How to check the 'queued' and 'sent' time and the delay?**

**From Debug Tool:** You can see that the delay here is 6 minutes which
occurred at our end as the delay occurred between the queued and the sent
state.

**From Logs:**

You can look for the exact timestamps of the queued time and the sent time
from OpenSearch as well as from the Server Logs in Ryuk.

  * Queue Time (OpenSearch): Filter by ""message_uuid"" and ""SMS queued to SharQ""  
In Ryuk under Plivo API:

  * Sent Time (OpenSearch): Filter by ""message_uuid"" and ""submit_sm""  
In Ryuk under Kannel:

The difference between the queued and sent time would give the delay.

For example:

From the above picture, we can see that there was a delay of 6 minutes on our
end. In such a case, we need to do the below checks:

  * If there is a delay, check the customer's MPS first. There are chances that the customer might be using a sub-account to trigger these messages, check the sub-account MPS as well (however, there are not many customers who have their MPS at a subaccount level. Most customers have their MPS set at the main account level. Also, keep in mind that the MPS for MMS and SMS are different).

  * Go to OpenSearch and search using the customer's 'AUTH_ID' or the number (in the case of the US/Canada), and see how many messages were triggered from their account/number in that particular time (you can take a range of 1 minute and see how many messages were triggered in that 1 minute). 

  * For non-US/Canada destinations, the messages would get dequeued as per the customer's MPS. Eg. Customer's SMS MPS is 5, but he's triggering 10,000 SMS per second, then there would be a delay for the messages to get dequeued.

  * Also, for the subaccounts, if the MPS is set to 3 and the MPS is set to 5 for the main account, the messages will go through 3 units per second from the sub-account triggered.

  * For US/Canada numbers, the messages would get dequeued based on the number type, i.e for long codes - 1 SMS/4sec, Tollfree - 40 SMS/sec, shortcode - 100 SMS/sec. Deque Rates' Article: _Link_

**OR**

  * We can use the Messaging Dashboard on Quicksight to get an account's MPS usage for the last 15 days.

  * If there are no issues found even after checking the above steps then try triggering an outbound message to your number and see if there's any delay.

  * We also need to check the _Plivo Status Page_ once. Otherwise, we can raise it to the MPT Team via a JIRA (_How to Create a JIRA Article_). 

### b. Delay from Carrier:

We check the difference between the sent and the delivered time and see if the
delivered time has a huge delay after the sent time.

**How to check the sent and delivered time and the delay?  **

The same way we checked the delay in the queuing time at our end as mentioned
in my previous point.

**From Debug Tool:**

**From Logs in OpenSearch (although this is not required as we can get the
exact delay time from the time graph shown above):**

  * Sent Time: Filter by ""message_uuid"" and ""submit_sm""

  * Delivered Time: Filter by ""message_uuid"" and ""deliver_sm""

The difference between the sent and delivered time would give the delay.

For example:

In the above picture, we can see that the message took 14384090 milliseconds
(4 hours) to get delivered. So there was a delay of 4 hours from our carrier's
end.

  * If the message is queued and de-queued (sent) from our end without any issue/delay, and if the message is delivered from the carrier's end after a delay, then we raise it with the carrier.

  * We can also do a quick delivery test or perform a CSG test to check the delay through carriers (if any).

  * We can also check the Plivo and Carrier status page for any notice regarding delays that might be related to the messages reported by the customer.

## 2\. Content Alteration:

This would be a case where the customer has reported an issue where the
message content sent out is different from the message content received on the
end user's device.

  * We would first need the message content that was received on the end user's device (preferably a screenshot as it would be solid proof in case we need to reach out to our carrier). 

  * Check the submit_sm's dump from OpenSearch to see what was sent from Plivo's platform. You can also find this in Ryuk under the Kannel Logs:

  * We can use this _Dump Decoder_ to decode the dump to see what message content is sent to our outbound carrier and compare it with the actual message on the end user's device. 

  * If we find that the same content received from the customer's end and the one sent from us are different, then we should work with our outbound carrier to find the cause.

note

Most of the issues happen in terms of the ""Unicode"" character. In this case,
we should always check from OpenSearch the Unicode character and convert it
into the actual character and compare if the customer has sent the same or
not. If the character has changed from our end we will have to check that with
the engineering team and if the content has not changed from our end and same
as what has been sent from the customer, then we will have to check with the
outbound carrier.

Most of the issues happen in terms of the ""Unicode"" character. In this case,
we should always check from OpenSearch the Unicode character and convert it
into the actual character and compare if the customer has sent the same or
not. If the character has changed from our end we will have to check that with
the engineering team and if the content has not changed from our end and same
as what has been sent from the customer, then we will have to check with the
outbound carrier.

Also, there are a few characters that are listed as both GSM and Unicode. In
such cases, Plivo will do a GSM encoding instead of Unicode.

There are various online tools to check the Unicode character and get the
actual character. One of the links is given below:

_Decode or Encode Unicode Text - Online Toolz_

Additionally, customers can check the number of characters present in their message content, and the number of units their content sums up to, by using the tool mentioned in this document: _Encoding and Concatenation | Plivo Developers_. 

This tool also detects the encoding type of the content and also helps detect
the Unicode characters present in the content.

**Some general queries related to SMS concatenation:**

  * If a message contains GSM characters then 160 characters would be considered as 1 unit, and any character after that would be considered as a second unit of the same long message.

  * If a message contains at least 1 Unicode character, 70 characters in the same message would be considered as 1 unit and the remaining character would be considered as the second unit.

## 3\. Sender ID Alteration:

This issue would arise when the customer reports that for his messages, the
Sender ID is being replaced at the end user's device. Follow the below steps
to debug this type of issue.

  * Ask the customer for the message UUIDs and the sender ID that has been shown on the end user's device (preferably a screenshot). 

  * Check the country the messages are being sent to and see if the customer is abiding by all the country-level regulations that are mentioned on our _SMS Coverage Page_. There are three types of countries:  
**I. Dynamic sender ID Countries:** Customers can send messages using any
sender ID to these countries, but if the messages are coming through a non-
alphanumeric sender ID, Plivo will automatically replace it with the
registered sender ID in their account.  
**II. Preregistration sender ID Countries:** For these countries, the customer
would need to register their Sender IDs from our console, in order to be able
to send messages to them.  
**III. Countries that do not support Sender IDs:** SMS will be delivered but
the sender ID used in the From number will be replaced with local numbers or
short codes or a generic code based on the country's regulation for delivery.

  * Depending on what category the country falls under and its sender ID regulations (mentioned on our SMS coverage page), we would need to check if it is expected behaviour for the Sender ID to be replaced with any other local number or a shortcode or a generic code. 

  * If it is an expected behaviour, then we can educate the customer about why his Sender ID is being replaced. 

  * If it is not expected behaviour, we would need to reach out to our outbound carrier to investigate this issue further. 

Sample Tickets:

  * Sender ID getting replaced due to operator regulation

  * Sender ID not being retained due to the country regulation

  * Sender ID getting replaced due to carrier issue

  * Unique Sender ID case for South Africa

## 4\. Fake/False Delivery Issue:

This issue would be reported by the customer when the messages are in the
delivered state but the customer claims that the messages did not reach the
end user's handset.

  * In such cases, we would need to check if the customer is sending his messages by following all the rules and regulations of the country. For example, Iran falls under DR countries which basically means that you would not have to pre-register your sender ID in order to be able to send messages to this country. The customer has reported that his messages to MCI operator numbers are being fake delivered. According to the country regulations of Iran, we would need to pre-register our SID so that we can send messages to MCI operator numbers. If the customer is found sending unregistered traffic, we need to ask him to first get his traffic registered and then let us know if the issue persists. 

  * Most of the time these issues are reported for only a single destination number. In cases like these, please request the customer to help us with samples with 2-3 unique destination numbers that faced fake delivery (The reason being, most of our carriers tend to isolate the case as a handset/end-user issue if only 1 destination number is reported. Getting more unique destination samples will help us build a stronger case with our carrier). 

  * Once we have the samples and see that the customer is abiding by the rules, reach out to the carrier and check why the messages were not delivered to the end-users, in spite of receiving a deliver_sm (delivery report/DLR). 

  * It is also a good practice to check the Plivo status page as well. 

# Under Undelivered Samples:

Each undelivered sample has a Plivo Error Code and a Carrier Error Code.
Sometimes these codes are self-explanatory and we should inform the customers
that there would not be any need to reach out to our carriers.

## 1\. SPAM Error:

### i. Blocked by Plivo (common for all countries):

Plivo has a Keyword Blocker feature available on Ryuk (https://ryuk-
vue.ovilp.io/sms/keyword_blocker/content/). This feature helps us control SPAM
by blocking messages that contain certain keywords (added on the Ryuk page) at
the Plivo level so that they do not reach the carriers.

Advantages:

  1. Better identification of accounts sending SPAM/Prohibited content.

  2. Lesser violation complaints from carriers.

Loom for reference:
https://www.loom.com/share/e354e3e561484820b0a8b5b4dc9cc14b

  * Check the carrier error code received from the messages marked as SPAM (Plivo Error Code: 30)

  * If the carrier error code is 2000, then the message was blocked by Plivo and did not reach the carrier.   
Example:

note

For the customers, on the console, this message would look exactly similar to
any normal message that was marked as SPAM by the carriers.

For the customers, on the console, this message would look exactly similar to
any normal message that was marked as SPAM by the carriers.

  * Check the message content and try to identify the keyword that raised the block.

  * We can search for the keywords under: https://ryuk-vue.ovilp.io/sms/keyword_blocker/content/

  * If the content looks to be non-spammy and the block is a false positive, we can reach out to MPT with the details for further analysis. 

  * If we are able to identify the keyword that led to the block and the content looks to be SPAM or disallowed content, inform the customer that the messages were marked as SPAM due to prohibited/SPAM content.

### ii. Blocked by Carrier:

### a.  For Non-US/Canadian countries -

We do not usually see a lot of SPAM error messages for international
messaging.  

  * Check the message sample and see if the message is sent to a valid number by checking in the lookup. See if the customer has sent messages to that number/s previously and also check the message state of those messages. 

  * We can also check the customer's message content and see if it seems like SPAM. 

  * Check if there are any Sender ID regulations towards that country if the customer is abiding by them.

  * Check if we have received a carrier error code from the carrier and also the Plivo error code. If the error code is self-explanatory, then inform the customer as to why the messages were not delivered. 

  * Otherwise, raise it with the carrier. 

### b. For  US/Canada:

  * Check the message sample and see if the message is sent to a valid number by checking in the lookup.

  * Check if the SMS content abides by the Best practices. 

  * Check the source number from which the messages were triggered.

    * For TFN:

      * Check if the number is a verified TFN or not.

      * Check the carrier error code received for the message. If it is self-explanatory, inform the customer about the same.

      * Check if the customer is using URLs in the message content. If yes, check if the URLs have multiple redirects. If yes, inform the customer. 

      * Also, check the status page of both, Plivo and Zipwhip.

      * Check the verification form submitted on the ZW portal to check if the message content matches their use case or not.

        * If it does not match and looks like SPAM, we can inform the customer that the probable reason for a SPAM block can also be when the message contents sent do not match with the use case the TFN was verified for. And reach out to the carrier for further details on the block.

        * If it matches the use case and everything looks legit, reach out to the carrier with the samples to request further clarification on the blocks.

    * For LC:

      * For the US:

        * Check the use case of the 10DLC campaign the number is linked to.

        * Check the carrier error code received for the message. If it is self-explanatory, inform the customer about the same.

        * If the use case looks the same as the message content of the message, reach out to the carrier for further explanation.

      * For CA:

        * Check the message content and see if there is any presence of SPAM/prohibited words or if they're following the best practices for US/CA messaging or not.

        * Check the carrier error code received for the message. If it is self-explanatory, inform the customer about the same.

        * Reach out to the carrier for further clarification.

    * For SC:

      * The steps are the same as TFN.

      * We can get the campaign details for the SC from the carrier's console.

Sometimes messages are blocked as SPAM on TFs, even for verified genuine cases
i.e., False Positives. Zipwhip removes the block after verifying the reported
messages.

As per Zipwhip, cases are marked as spam if they observe a slight variation in
content, or if the message strays away from general messaging best practices,
or if the customer is using words that match already existing SPAM messages
that have been verified and blocked as SPAM. In such cases, a content-based
fingerprint is triggered at ZW's SPAM platform.

Some common scenarios where verified traffic can be marked as SPAM:

  * Sending party ambiguity,

  * Lack of opt-out keywords,

  * The similarity in content to other SPAM campaigns. (For example, phrases like ""your home insurance quotes are ready!"", ""We just shopped your auto insurance. View your quotes here"" are commonly considered 'auto insurance' spam campaigns. Adding a company name and opt-out keywords can resolve the issue.)

## 2\. Unknown Error:

  * Check if the customer is adhering to all the country and Sender ID regulations. 

  * If we do not see any reason for the message failure, we can reach out to the carrier to find the root cause of the delivery failure.  

    * We also need to ask the carrier for the reason for the error representing the specific carrier error code. 

    * Once we have the carrier error code information, we need to raise an MPT to get the carrier error code mapped. 

## 3\. Invalid Destination Number:

  * If the customer's messages are undelivered because of error code 50, then it means that the customer is sending SMS to invalid destination numbers, or not SMS-enabled numbers, or to PSTN landline.

  * In order to avoid this, we can suggest the customer enable _Enhanced Destination Number Validation_ from his console. When enabled, messages to invalid numbers and numbers that are not SMS-enabled will be rejected. Plivo API will return a 400 Bad Request HTTP response for such requests.

  * Before informing the customer about the above point , we can check in Ryuk (under Additional Feature) if this feature is already enabled for the customer or not. 

  * However, if the Destination Number Validation is already enabled for the customer but still he is getting an unusually very high number of this error code and he claims that the messages are being sent to the correct destination numbers, we can make an exception and report this issue to our carrier for further validation. 

## 4\. Other Error Codes:  

  * Messages undelivered with any other Each undelivered sample has a Plivo Error Code and a Carrier Error Code. Sometimes these codes are self-explanatory and we should inform the customers and there would not be any need to reach out to our carriers. 

  * In case we need additional clarity, we can reach out to the carrier. 

# Under Sent Samples:

These are messages for which we do not receive any DLRs from the carriers. We
can follow the below steps for this issue:

  * If a customer reports that the messages are in the Sent state, check if delivery receipts/reports are supported towards the country reported from our _SMS Coverage Page_. 

  * If the customer is following the country's regulations or not.

  * If delivery reports/receipts are supported, then reach out to the carrier by helping them with the message samples. 

  * If the delivery reports are not supported for that country, we can educate the customer about the same. 

  * Also, check with the customer if the messages have reached the handset or not. If not reached, then you would have to reach out to the carrier. 

  * For the messages being sent out from Plivo source numbers (source-based routing) (Countries: US, Canada):

    * Check if all the messages from that particular source number are facing this issue. 

      * If yes:

        * Check the number configuration from Ryuk and see if the SMS capabilities are correctly marked and mapped. 

        * Check the carrier website to see if the number is active and in service. 

        * If everything looks fine, we need to reach out to the carrier who owns the number. 

      * If no: 

        * We can directly reach out to the carrier involved. 

# Under Failed Samples:

## 1\. Messages failing with Plivo Error Code 300(towards US/Canada):

  * In such cases, go to Ryuk and check the Gotham logs. 

  * Check if you find a reason for the failure of the messages by going through the logs. Usually, you can figure out the issue through the logs themselves. 

  * Example of one such error: ""Could not get source-based routing: No gateway ID or gateway name found in config"". 

  * In such cases, raise the issue with the SMS Team.

  * Sometimes, SMS/MMS fail to be dispatched from our end due to connectivity issues with the carrier - one such example is Syniverse:  
{""level"":""error"",""ts"":""2020-09-10T17:26:38Z"",""caller"":""gandalf/service.go:97"",""msg"":""ERROR

In such cases, please reach out to the engineering team immediately.

## 2\. SMS Failure due to Pricing issue (We would get error code 90 for such
cases):

  * This issue is not very commonly seen. 

  * Check if the customer has credits. 

  * Check if messages to other countries are going through from their account without any issues.

  * If no issue in the above 2 conditions, go to Ryuk and check the Gotham logs of the message sample. 

  * Check the error reason mentioned in Gotham

  * If the following error is seen: ""No rate/prefix matching dst number: Could not find outgoing SMS charge for groupid= ****. Error: record not found (404)"", then this means to say that there is no pricing updated for that particular SMS Group ID/Name

  * To debug this error, go to the SMS configuration -> Outbound SMS group in Ryuk and filter by the country the customer is facing the issue with. Check the SMS group name associated with that particular SMS group ID. 

  * Then go to, Outbound SMS Pricing, and check for the country the customer is facing an issue. Check-in global pricing if the customer is on the Standard Product Plan, or if the customer has a custom product plan, then check under the Product Plan Pricing Tab. This step is performed to check if there is any pricing associated with that SMS Group Name. 

  * Check if there is pricing updated for that SMS Group. If not, then reach out to the concerned team.

  * Also, the MCC and MNC need to be mapped to the outgoing SMS group. To check if it is mapped to the SMS group name, navigate _here_. If it is not mapped, reach out to the concerned team.

## 3\. Geo-Permissions:

  * This error code is pretty simple and straightforward. If the customer reports that his messages are failing with the error code 450, this means that the Geo-Permissions for that country for their account were disabled at the time the message was triggered. 

  * To verify the current status of Geo-Permissions, we can use Ryuk: https://ryuk-vue.ovilp.io/sms/sms-geo-permissions/home

  * If it is disabled, ask the customer to enable his SMS geo-permissions for that country from his Plivo console (https://console.plivo.com/sms/settings/fraud-shield/) in order to send messages. 

# Miscellaneous Delivery Issue:

## 1\. Sandbox Issue:

  * This type of issue would fail at an API level. 

  * If a customer is on a free trial/developer account, it is mandatory for him to sandbox the destination number to which he wishes to send an SMS.

  * On Ryuk, under,_account settings_ you would be able to check the destination numbers the customer has sandboxed.

  * If they have not sandboxed the destination number, then we need to educate them about the same. 

  * Link to navigate to the sandbox numbers page: _https://console.plivo.com/phone-numbers/sandbox-numbers/_

  * The customer can sandbox only 5 numbers. They cannot delete any of the sandboxed numbers.

## 2\. US source number not mapped to a 10DLC campaign.

  * This type of issue would fail at an API level. 

  * This would happen when a customer is sending a message to the US and their Plivo US source number is not 10DLC linked. 

  * Check if the customer has any active 10DLC campaigns from https://ryuk-vue.ovilp.io/sms/10dlc/campaigns/

  * If he does not, inform the customer that we would need to register for 10DLC and link his US local number to an active campaign in order to send messages to the US. 

  * If he does, ask the customer to link their US local number to an appropriate campaign depending on their use case.

# Identifying the state of the Inbound message

**Different States**| **Description**  
---|---  
**Received**|  When a message is successfully received on the Plivo number and
the logs are available in the user console.  
**Delivered**|  When the message is received successfully on the Plivo number,
and the details are posted to the webhook URL provided in the XML
application's **message_url**.  
**Undelivered**|  When the message is received successfully on the Plivo
number, but details were not posted to the **message_url**.  
Related Articles: _What are the different SMS statuses in Plivo?_  
  
* * *

# Account details {Type, credits, active or not} and Plivo status page.

  * Check the customer's account and that the user is enabled and active on Ryuk

  * The account must have sufficient credits to receive an Inbound message > We can check the required pricing on our _pricing_ page based on the Plivo number region.

  * Simultaneously we can check Plivo Status in case of any incidents related to Inbound messages.

* * *

# Number config {configured correctly or not, SMS enabled or not}

  * Check the Plivo number configuration on Ryuk > Number Management > Account Phone numbers.  

  * The Plivo number must be SMS enabled and attached to an XML application or PHLO for further action once a message is received.

  * Check if the phone number is verified in the carrier portal.

  * Verify if there are any regulations to receive an SMS on that number on the carrier portal. Also, check if the correct carrier tier is attached to the number. 

* * *

# Loglines in Ryuk and OpenSearch

## ** _For Received Messages:_**

Check the inbound message details in Ryuk > Messages > Fetch MDR. We can check
the details via FromNumber/ToNumber/TimeStamp or Message_UUID. Or we can check
the account-based message log in OpenSearch.

  * **Reasons for messages to remain in ""Received State"": **  
No application attached to a Plivo number  
No message_url configured for the assigned application

* * *

## ** _For Delivered Messages:_**

We can check the AntService log in Ryuk for the 200 response of the
message_url callback. In OpenSearch, we can either get the logs using the
message_uuid or source number.

* * *

## **_For the Undelivered messages_** _:_

We can check AntService log in Ryuk for the HTTP response we received. In
OpenSearch, we can either get the logs using the message_uuid or source
number. As we can see we received 404 [Not found] for each retry.  

note

**For Undelivered samples, the details would not be posted to the message URL
in the below scenarios:  **

  * The message URL is not valid or responding.

  * The message URL is responding with a 5XX HTTP Response Code.

  * Method not allowed - If the customer's server(message URL) does not accept the REQUEST method made by Plivo.

**For Undelivered samples, the details would not be posted to the message URL
in the below scenarios:  **

  * The message URL is not valid or responding.

  * The message URL is responding with a 5XX HTTP Response Code.

  * Method not allowed - If the customer's server(message URL) does not accept the REQUEST method made by Plivo.

Callback Retries

Will Plivo retry callbacks if the message_url is not reachable?

If the customer's web server is returning a 5xx error, we need to inform the
customer to work on this on his end. Along with 5xx, in the case of 404, we
need to check with the customer

If we are unable to post the details to the message_url, note the error and
the cause. Check with engineering if needed.

* * *

# Exceptional case: Message sent from customer's end but not received by Plivo

  * In this case, the customer may claim that they have sent the message from their end with Sent status but no logs are shown for the same in the console. We need to check the MDR logs in Ryuk for the customer account and if no details are available, check the logs in OpenSearch (using account AuthID or account ID) if we had any Inbound message requests in the customer's account.

    * **Note:** MDRs are not generated for Inbound Messages when there is insufficient balance in the customer's account. To identify such cases, follow the below steps:

      1. Ask the customer for the from number, to number, timestamps and the message contents. 

      2. Reach out to the inbound carrier to see if these messages were received by them and if they were forwarded to Plivo. 

      3. If the carrier mentions that they forwarded the message to Plivo, reach out to MPT via a Jira to reconfirm this issue was due to 'no credits'. 

      4. Example Jira for reference: MPT-38325716a1bd-8643-326a-a4de-0c4aa5635486System JIRA

  * In case of any error message, we can inform the customer about the same.

  * Perform required testing for the Plivo number reported and share observations with the carrier.

  * Isolate problematic number providers (inbound carriers) and advise customers to use alternate numbers that belong to other carriers while the problematic number providers fix the issue. 

  * If the customer requests for missed messages, check with the inbound carriers. 

If no logs, we must ask for message details from the customer along with the
screenshot and reach out to Inbound Carrier associated with that number in
Number management.

* * *

# CSG/Number testing and message-sending test (after customer consent)

  * Perform CSG testing (steps _here_) and SMS testing (using Ryuk) on our end and share details with the carrier if the results are correct.

  * Ask the customer if we can try out sending a test message

* * *

# Carrier involvement, if not an issue at Plivo's end

  * In case no logs are found on our end then, we have to contact the Inbound carrier (as per the contact list shared here or search for the associated carrier in the confluence doc)

  * Before contacting the carrier in Inbound, please gather information from the customer such as FromNumber, ToNumber, Exact TimeStamp, and a screenshot of the message(preferred).

account through the console itself by clicking _here_. It is a simple step
where customers are charged $25 as a one-time fee for upgrading the Plivo
account, which is also added to their account credits, which they can use
later.

**FAQ: All Aboard for Clarity**

 _**Q: Is there any plan to enhance the transparency of the risk assessment
process?**_

A. Regrettably, our risk assessment process is a closely guarded treasure,
known only to Plivo. We must keep the secrets of our ship safe.

_**Q: What measures are being taken to ensure that legitimate users won't be
denied services under the new** system?_

A: We've scoured the seven seas of data over the past 7 months and found our
algorithm to be a trusty shipmate, identifying fraud with pinpoint precision.
False alarms have been as rare as a mermaid sighting. Still, for extra safety,
Sales and CSM-managed accounts will enjoy special privileges as we navigate
these waters.

# SOP - Risk Status upgrade requests

Upon signing up with Plivo, customers may face payment restrictions based on
their company credentials. These restrictions are in place to prevent misuse
and can limit monthly payments to as low as $1000. Customers can request an
account upgrade by contacting Plivo's support team for a higher payment limit
or to have the limit removed. This document outlines the process for
evaluating and processing these requests.

## xScope of Work for Plivo's Support Team:

**Team**| **Role**  
---|---  
Support Team|

  1. Eligibility check
    1. Usage check
  2. Account hygiene check
  3. Use case validation
  4. Risk status modification (The support team will be responsible for conducting the change in risk status to ensure proper logging of the associated ticket number at the time of risk status modification.)

  
  
## Eligibility

To be eligible for a risk status upgrade, an account must have a minimum of
$50 of product usage in the last 15 days.

Our logs are stored for only 15 days, making it essential for the Finsys team
to analyze traffic legitimacy. Therefore, a minimum of $50 worth of product
usage in a single month is required to ensure sufficient usage for analysis.

#### Action

Upgrade requests will be declined if there is no usage in the last 15 days.

## Exception:

An account with a significantly reduced balance due to 10DLC registration can
be upgraded to medium risk with the note 'Upgrade for 10DLC registration,
ZD-<TicketNumber>.'

If the sales or customer success team has thoroughly checked the account, the
support team can upgrade the account to the requested risk status without
further review or meet eligibility criteria.

Otherwise, the Finsys PM should review the account before proceeding with the
upgrade.

## Usage Check Guidelines for Customer Accounts:

If the customer meets the eligibility criteria, please analyze their usage
pattern.

  * For phone number subscriptions, ask about the use case for multiple subscriptions.

  * For number lookup, inquire about the use case.

  * No extra usage info is needed for messaging, voice, Zentrunk, or other Plivo services.

note

## Basic Hygiene Checks for Support Team

## Basic Hygiene Checks for Support Team

The Support Team should carry out the basic hygiene checks outlined in the
table below before submitting the request to the Finsys account management
team

**Basic Checks**| **Intention** This is to prevent any instances of
impersonation that could result in account misuse.**Action** If request is
from a different domain, ask for registered email or account verification info

  * Account Name
  * Signup Date
  * Invoice ID of last 3 months
  * Last 4 digits of the card/cards
  * Location of last login
  * Registered phone number.

  
---|---  
**Ensure that the request originates from a registered email or same domain.**  
**Check for similar domain registered accounts**| **Intention** To prevent
invoice delinquency, differentiate company-managed from individually-managed
accounts. Personal accounts created using work emails won't be penalized for
unrelated unpaid invoices.**Action**

  * Enquire the reason for multiple accounts.
  * Enquire the reason for unpaid invoices, if any.

  
**Account Information**| **Intention** Assessing account legitimacy based on
signup information is our priority. Any discrepancy between service address,
billing address, signup country, phone number country, and card country is
considered a red flag.**Action (Details to be reviewed for Ryuk):**

  * When submitting the upgrade request, please mention any discrepancies found in the following details for Ryuk account:
    * Signup date
    * Signup country
    * Signup IP
    * Service address
    * Billing address
    * Phone number country
    * Card country
  * These details will be reviewed by the Finsys account management team.

  
**Payment pattern**|  If the account payment history shows consecutive
payments made in a short time, notify the Finsys team. However, please take
into account that customers who have registered for 10DLC may make consecutive
payments, which is not unusual.  
**Card addition limit**|  If the risk status upgrade is related to the card
addition limit, please inquire with the customer about the reason for adding
multiple cards.  
note

## Guidelines for Use Case Verification and Submission

## Guidelines for Use Case Verification and Submission

3712779953,Recharges and Coupons,"There are two types of recharges that can be triggered by the customers-

**Auto-Recharges**|  Auto-recharges are triggered when the accounts reach the
threshold amount set by the customers on their accounts. The system
automatically charges the default card with the auto-recharge amount set.  
---|---  
**Manual Recharges**|  The customers can also manually top-up their account as
and when required from the console.  
  
We can check the recharges done by the customers on the Payments Tab in Ryuk -
_Ryuk Payment Tab Link_

There are certain scenarios when the card is not charged by the system and the
payments fail. Below is the consolidated list -

Stripe API response (Ryuk)| When do we see this| Actions to take| Reference
Tickets  
---|---|---|---  
Stripe blocked as too risky| Stripe declined due to high risk_score| We should
ask the customer to use a different cardIn case of follow-up, reach out to the

"
3712779993,US/CA Messaging,"SMS features and regulations in the US and Canada are directly dependent on
the source number used for sending an SMS. In the US, there are three possible
types of source numbers that one might use to send an SMS:

  1. Local phone numbers (a.k.a. long codes)

  2. Toll-free numbers (1-8xx)

  3. Shortcodes

**SHAFT** sex, hate, alcohol, firearms, tobacco content is strictly prohibited
in US and Canada.

## **Long Codes**

|  Long codes are regular 10-digit phone numbers capable of sending and
receiving texts and voice calls.Long codes have the following advantages over
other source number types:

  * They are relatable, personal, and therefore more likely to garner a response from the recipient.
  * They are easy to procure and set up. Plivo's Phone Number API lets you programmatically search for and purchase phone numbers by region or prefix.

In the recent changes, all the traffic towards the US must be sent from the
registered number (10DLC). The unregistered traffic is like to be rejected by
the carrier due to spam.  
---|---  
  
## **Toll-Free numbers**

|  Toll-free numbers are well-suited for business messaging since people
already perceive toll-free numbers as business lines. They can be used to send
text messages at up to 40 SMS messages per second at a relatively low cost.As
per the recent changes, customers have to verify their Toll-Free numbers while
sending messages to the US as certain limits have been applied by the carrier
for messages. All messages sent toward Canadian destinations must be sent from
verified numbers.Toll-free messaging volume toward US destinations that exceed
daily, weekly, or monthly limits must come from verified numbers.

  * 2,000 messages per day
  * 12,000 messages per week
  * 25,0000 messages per month

Starting April 1, 2023, sending limits on unverified and pending verification
numbers are changing.Guidelines and other information can be found _here_.  
  
## Short Codes

| Shortcodes have the following advantages over other source number products:

  * Very high deliverability at maximum throughput (up to 100 SMS per second). You can be sure of your delivery metrics thanks to handset delivery receipts that are generated when the text message is successfully received.
  * Highly predictable delivery rates since your use case and SMS content shall be preapproved even before you start.

The drawback is that the provisioning cycle for shortcodes is the longest out
of all the available options typically eight to twelve weeks.Shortcodes
represent the sender identity (such as Amazon -> TX-AMZN or Zomato -> ZMTFD)
and most of the time it is used to send out transactional-based messages.  
  
# Primary checks must be followed for any outbound message delivery issues
toward the US  
  
---  
  
## **Long Codes**

|

  * Check if the Plivo US long code is SMS enabled and active in the customer account.
  * Verify if the correct carrier is mapped to that number.
  * In the message log on Ryuk, check if the number via which message is sent is linked to any 10DLC campaign as shown.
  * Check the message content if content-view is enabled and verify if it adheres to the US best practices.
  * If an issue is with a specific destination number then follow the steps mentioned in **Destination number validation (based on the error code)**
  * If no issues are found with the number then reach out to the carrier for more insight.
  * We can reach out to the product team (MPT) if the rejection happened in bulk and we have not got clarity from the carrier on the same.

|  
  
## **Toll-Free numbers**

|  For Canada; Messages must be sent via verified TF numbers only.Check the TF
number configuration in Ryuk > Number Management > Account Phone numbers and
see if the number is verified/unverified/pending verification.**Unverified
Status/Pending Verification/Verified numbers:**

  * Check the daily/weekly/monthly count of the messages in Ryuk or blog (_**Not valid for verified numbers**_)
  * If the limit was not exceeded then check then it is possible that the message was rejected due to Spam from the carrier's end.
  * Check the message content and verify if it adheres to the US best practices.
  * If an issue is with a specific destination number then follow the steps mentioned in Destination number validation (based on the error code).
  * If the rejection is consistent and to multiple numbers then recommend the customer to verify the TF number and simultaneously check with the carrier if the message content adheres to the best practices.
  * Check the status of the number in Zipwhip; just in case verification failed in pending_verification case.
  * We can reach out to the product team (MPT) if the rejection happened in bulk and we have not got clarity from the carrier on the same.

|  
  
## **Short Codes**

|

  * Check the Shortcode configuration in Ryuk > Shortcode > Shortcode Rentals. You need to search it with the account email or authid; Check if the shortcode is enabled.
  * Check if the shortcode is SMS enabled and not blocked in Ryuk > Number > Number history.
  * Check the recent message record of the shortcode and see if the issue is frequent or consistent.
  * Check the message content and verify if it adheres to the US best practices.
  * If an issue is with a specific destination number then follow the steps mentioned in Destination number validation (based on the error code)
  * If no issues are found on our end, we need to reach out to the carrier team for further explanation.
  * We can reach out to the product team (MPT) if the rejection happened in bulk and we have not got clarity from the carrier on the same.

|  
  
### For Messages Marked as SPAM:

## Blocked by Carriers

  1. Check the source number from which the messages were triggered. 

    1. For TFN:

      1. Check if the number is a verified TFN or not. 

      2. Check the carrier error code received for the message. If it is self-explanatory, inform the customer about the same.

      3. Check the verification form submitted on the ZW portal to check if the message content matches their use case or not.

        1. If it does not match and looks like SPAM, we can inform the customer that the probable reason for a SPAM block can also be when the message contents sent do not match with the use case the TFN was verified for. And reach out to the carrier for further details on the block. 

        2. If it matches the use case and everything looks legit, reach out to the carrier with the samples to request further clarification on the blocks.

    2. For LC: 

      1. For the US:

        1. Check the use case of the 10DLC campaign the number is linked to. 

        2. Check the carrier error code received for the message. If it is self-explanatory, inform the customer about the same.

        3. If the use case looks the same as the message content of the message, reach out to the carrier for further explanation. 

      2. For CA:

        1. Check the message content and see if there is any presence of SPAM/prohibited words or if they're following the best practices for US/CA messaging or not. 

        2. Check the carrier error code received for the message. If it is self-explanatory, inform the customer about the same.

        3. Reach out to the carrier for further clarification. 

    3. For SC: 

      1. The steps are the same as TFN. 

      2. We can get the campaign details for the SC from SAP's console. 

## Blocked by Plivo

[INFO] Plivo has a Keyword Blocker feature available on Ryuk (https://ryuk-
vue.ovilp.io/sms/keyword_blocker/content/). This feature helps us control SPAM
by blocking messages that contain certain keywords (added on the Ryuk page) at
the Plivo level so that they do not reach the carriers.

Advantages:

  1. Better identification of accounts sending SPAM/Prohibited content. 

  2. Lesser violation complaints from carriers. 

Loom for reference:
https://www.loom.com/share/e354e3e561484820b0a8b5b4dc9cc14b

* * *

  1. Check the carrier error code received from the messages marked as SPAM (Plivo Error Code: 30)

  2. If the carrier error code is 2000, then the message was blocked by Plivo and did not reach the carrier.   
Example:

[Note: For the customers, on the console, this message would look exactly
similar to any normal message that was marked as SPAM by the carriers.]

  3. Check the message content and try to identify the keyword that raised the block. 

  4. Inform the customer that the messages were marked as SPAM due to prohibited/SPAM content.

3712845833,International Messaging,"# Delivery Issues Troubleshooting Steps

## Identifying the state of the Outbound message

| **Queued** : All outbound messages are initially Queued => Plivo accepted
the message from a user and will make an attempt to send the message to a
carrier.**Failed** : This status is updated when Plivo is unable to forward
the message to the carrier. In this state, the user is not charged.**Sent** :
A message is marked as ""Sent"" when the message is successfully passed on to
the carrier from our side, but we have not received any delivery report from
the carrier. The user will be charged in this scenario.**Delivered** : When a
message delivery report is received from the carrier's end. The message is
delivered to the end user.**Undelivered** : The message is marked ""Delivered""
or ""Undelivered"" based on the delivery receipt received from the carrier. The
user will be charged in this scenario.Below are a few cases where the above
states may not match the exact situation.

  * Fake Delivery Issue: SMS did not reach the end-user. **{happens in Delivered State}**
  * Source replaced when message delivered. **{happens in Delivered State}**

**No state available:** The customer provides MDR (UUID) and reports issues
with SMS without any state information; Check OpenSearch logs and if no result
reach out to the product team with all details for more information.  
---|---  
  
## Account details {Type, credits, active or not} and Plivo status page

|

  * Check the customer's account and that the user is enabled and active on Ryuk.
  * The account must have sufficient credits to receive an Inbound message > We can check the required pricing on our pricing page based on the Plivo number region.
  * Simultaneously we can check the _Plivo Status_ page in case of any incidents related to Inbound messages.

**Developer account (Free-Trial)**

  * If a customer is on a free-trial/developer account, it is mandatory for him to sandbox the destination number to which he wishes to send an SMS.
  * On ryuk, under, account settings you would be able to check the destination numbers the customer has sandboxed.
  * If they have not sandboxed the destination number, then we need to educate them about the same. 
  * Link to navigate to the sandbox numbers page: _https://console.plivo.com/phone-numbers/sandbox-numbers/_
  * The customer can sandbox only 5 numbers. They cannot delete any of the sandboxed numbers.

  
  
## SID-based checks {coverage page, ryuk}

|

  * Check the SID regulation of the destination country on our _coverage page_.
  * Verify which SID registration the destination country support.
  * In case the customer has used an alphanumeric SID to send out the message then check if the customer has registered the same on Ryuk > Messaging > Senderid registration.
  * There could be cases where the message templates need to be whitelisted, in such cases, check the previous tickets and verify if the templates were whitelisted or not.
  * Few countries follow the different SID reg processes such as India, Singapore, Newzealand. Check the documentation for the same in our _support_ article and find the previous tickets to view the whitelisted template content. 

  
  
## Error code mapping and description

|

  * For the undelivered messages, check the error code mapping on Ryuk > Messaging > Error code mapping and check the carrier reason for rejection.
  * If the error reason is not justified then, we must check the previous tickets for the rejection reason.
  * If unable to find any result in previous tickets, check for how many users the message was rejected and then reach out to the carrier for further explanation.

  
  
## Destination number validation (based on the error code)

| The customer reported that when the ""_Enhanced Destination Number
Validation_"" feature is disabled for landlines, the messages are still being
dispatched to the carrier.

  * In such cases, go to Ryuk and search for the customer's account. Under Additional Feature, check if the customer has disabled the flag ""SMS landline texting Flag"" to ""Disabled"". If Disabled, this means that messages sent to all landlines would fail.
  * Check the destination numbers for which he is facing an issue in the lookup. If the number is actually a landline number, i.e a Fixed number, then we would have to raise it with the SMS Team. 

In case the error reason is due to the destination number then we need to
check if the number is valid or not in console > LookUp.

  * Check the recent message record to the respective destination number and see if the messages were rejected consistently or frequently.
  * If consistent then, test the message to another destination, and check the result.
  * If frequent then, then check the message content for rejected or delivered messages, we can also reach out to the carrier in such cases.

  
  
## Loglines in Ryuk and OpenSearch

###  _**For Queued Messages:  **_

If the message stays longer in the Queue, the state for the same would be
shown as below in Ryuk, we can check the Gotham logs to view error messages if
any.|  
---|---  
In case no error message is there in Gotham logs, we need to search the message_uuid in OpenSearch for detailed logs. |   
Check the customer's account MPS limit as well as the number level (messages
allowed per number)|  
  
* * *

### _**For Failed Messages:**_

If the message stays longer in the Queue, the state for the same would be
shown as below in Ryuk, we can check the Gotham logs to view error messages if
any.|  
---|---  
In case no error message is there in Gotham logs, we need to search the
message_uuid in OpenSearch for detailed logs.|  
There could be multiple reasons for message failure which can be identified
via the error code (such as 900, 200, 450, more). Plivo does not charge for
any failed message.|  
**Messages failing with Plivo Error Code 300(towards US/Canada)**|

  * In such cases, go to Ryuk and check the Gotham logs. 
  * Check if you find a reason for the failure of the messages by going through the logs. Usually, you can figure out the issue through the logs itself. Example of one such error: ""Could not get source-based routing: No gateway ID or gateway name found in config"". 
  * In such cases, raise the issue with the SMS Team.

Sometimes, SMS/MMS fail to be dispatched from our end due to connectivity
issues with the carrier - one such example is Syniverse:

  * In such cases, please reach out to the engineering team immediately.

  
---|---  
**SMS Failure due to Pricing issue:  **|

  * Check if the customer has credits
  * Check if messages to other countries are going through from their account without any issues.
  * If no issue in the above 2 conditions, go to ryuk and check the Gotham logs of the message sample.
  * Check the error reason mentioned in Gotham.
  * If the following error is seen: ""_**No rate/prefix matching dst number: Could not find outgoing SMS charge for groupid= ****. Error: record not found (404)** "", _then this means to say that there is no pricing updated for that particular SMS Group ID/Name.
  * To debug this error, go to the SMS configuration -> Outbound SMS group in ryuk and filter by the country the customer is facing the issue with. Check the SMS group name associated with that particular SMS group ID. 
  * Then go to, Outbound SMS Pricing, check for the country the customer is facing an issue. Check-in global pricing if the customer is on the Standard Product Plan, or if the customer has a custom product plan, then check under the Product Plan Pricing Tab. This step is performed to check if there is any pricing associated with that SMS Group Name. 
  * Check if there is pricing updated for that SMS Group. If not, then reach out to the concerned team.
  * Also, the MCC and MNC need to be mapped to the outgoing SMS group. To check if it is mapped to the SMS group name, navigate here. If it is not mapped, reach out to the concerned team.

  
  
* * *

### _**For Sent Messages**_

The Sent message states confirm that the message was successfully forwarded
from our side to the carrier for delivery, but we have not received any
delivery report for the same due to which it remained in the Sent state.|  
---|---  
The sent message does not confirm that the message was actually sent to the
users so a customer may reach out to us to know its status, hence, we need to
first check our coverage page to verify the destination's deliverability.|  
In case the issue is reported for a specific destination, we can ask the
customer to try out sending a message to another destination and also inform
them about the deliverability.  
If multiple destinations, we can reach out to the carrier team with a sample
if delivery is reliable for the destination country. In case not reliable we
can still reach out to the carrier to know the reason why messages were not
delivered and the next steps.  
  
* * *

### _**For Delivered Messages**_

The delivered state is only reflected based on the delivery report from the
carrier, however, sometimes it does not confirm the actual delivery which is
called as Fake delivery. So in such cases, we have to reach out to the carrier
team for further explanation as we cannot determine the same on our end.

In such cases, we must also perform SID-based checks and inform customers
based on the destination country.

**Below are the checks we can do on our end:**  
---  
Check queued and delivery time of the message and see if there is no delay
from our or carrier's end|  
Check details such as Carrier, Network, Content classification.|  
Check API logs to confirm if API request or not, we can also see message
content here if not concealed by the customer.|  
Check Kannel log to see what we have submitted to the carrier (submit_sm) and
if the carrier has shared the delivery report for the same (deliver_sm).|  
For reductant messages; we can decode the DUMP values (shown above) in
sysop.fr or some other decoder to view the exact message content sent from our
side.  
**Source replaced when message delivered**| **** In such cases, we must check
the Kannel logs and see **submit_sm** is according to the customer use case.
If everything seems on our end, we can reach out to the carrier with a
screenshot of the message (obtained from the customer) for further
explanation.  
---|---  
**For Fake delivery issues**|  Make sure to confirm the below details from the
customer before reaching out to the carrier.

  * Confirm from the customer if the issue is happening with multiple destinations or specific.
  * Confirm if a customer observing the issue consistently or frequently.
  * Make sure to share samples for multiple destinations as the carrier may reject the request pointing to a specific destination issue.

  
  
* * *

### _**For Undelivered Messages**_

  * Need to check the reason for the rejection of the message and perform the steps mentioned in the Error code mapping and description.

  * For messages towards the US/CA, we can verify the message content and see if it adheres to the _best practices_ mentioned in our docs. This also goes for message rejection such as Spam or Prohibited by the carrier.

  * If it does not adhere to the best practices, inform the customer about the same if content-view is enabled for the customer account else follow Content verification and customer consent steps 

  * Check the recent message record of the customer account and see any similar pattern (such as rejection towards a specific region, any specific operator, specific destination affected, or multiple).

  * For Spam messages apart from US/CA, we should once check our coverage page and see if there are any country regulations for the message content.

    * We also need to check if the SPAM block was done by the carrier or Plivo. 

    * For blocks made by the carrier, we can reach out to the carrier for further clarification.

    * For blocks made by Plivo, follow the steps mentioned: https://plivo-team.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PSA/pages/3712779993/US+CA+Messaging#Blocked-by-Plivo

  * In undelivered cases also, we may perform SID-based checks and a CSG test

* * *

## Content verification and customer consent.

| We can view the Incoming and Outgoing message content in Ryuk and OpenSearch
logs, however, we've provided an Option in the _console_ that allows users to
give their consent to view messages.|  
---|---|---  
Make sure the Content-View Authorization (in Ryuk) is enabled for the customer
account (as shown below) if you're mentioning the message content in your
response if not, we can request the customer to enable it, and then inform
about the same. We can share _this_ support article to explain the same to the
customer.|  
  
## Carrier involvement if not an issue at Plivo's end

|

  1. If no issues were found on our end, need to contact the Outbound carrier as per the contact list shared _here_. 
  2. We can also search for the associated carrier in the confluence doc.- Some of the carriers (such as Tata/ Airtel) ask for a Message ID (Kannel Message ID) in order to investigate the issue at their end, so we should make a practice to share the below details while sharing the samples with the carrier.  
**From, To, Time, MessageID**  
From must be copied from the Kannel logs as shown below and MessageID can be
found in the mdr with the name Kannel MesageID

## FAQs and involvement of associated articles and docs.

|

  * Why were we charged for an undelivered SMS message? Why were we charged for a message that never reached the destination number?
  * Can the source number for an outbound text message to US/CA be a non-Plivo number?
  * Can we hide the message content and source number while sending a message?
  * Why did my outbound SMS delivery fail?

3712845860,Sender ID & Content Related Issues and Queries,"# Sender ID

Sender ID is the name/source that appears as the message sender of an SMS
message on the recipient's device. Sender IDs are a useful way to identify the
sender of the messages and related business.

Support for sender ID varies by country. For example, carriers in the United
States and Canada don't support sender IDs, whereas carriers in India require
business use cases.

Sender ID can be a number (i.e. a Mobile Phone Number) or an alpha-numeric
term such as ZOMATO, or FLPKRT.

# Content Related Issues

## For Inbound messages

|

  * Check the message content (Ryuk or OpenSearch) received on our end.
  * Compare the text received and shared by the customer in the screenshot.
  * In case a partial message was received then, it is possible that the message was not concatenated on our end,  in such cases the messages would've come to our system as different messages.

Our SMPP gateway(Kannel) concatenates all the parts to create one single
concatenated message. In the below scenario, we received all the parts of the
message from the carrier, but the messages were treated as different
messages(multi-part) because different parts of the multipart message came to
different kannels in our system. **Case 1:** The message is received on our
platform on 2 different kannels, kannel7 and kannel5. Hence, the message was
not concatenated, and it was split into multi-parts. In this case, we would
have to reach out to the inbound carrier. **Case 2:** In case, the message has
reached the same kannel, but in different parts, say part 1 and part 2. Check
the time at which these parts were received on our platform. _Part 1:
31-03-2020 11:23:48 AM UTC_ _Part2: 31-03-2020 11:34:59 AM UTC_ In the above
case, part 2 was received 11 minutes after part 1 was received. In order for
the message to be concatenated, each part of the message should be received
within 10 minutes of it's preceding part. Since part 2 was received after 10
mins of part 1, the message would not be concatenated.|

3713138751,2FA Verification for Plivo Console,"## **_Overview_**

  * Customers now protect their Plivo user credentials using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). 2FA provides an additional level of security by asking for a unique verification code sent to their mobile when they login into their account.

  * The option of setting up 2FA verification or changing the number set up is available under Settings on the console in Security Tab.

**_Scenarios when Support receives 2FA verification tickets  _**

**Scenarios**| **Actions to take**| **Reference Tickets**  
---|---|---  
Customers wish to change their 2FA verified number | 

  1. We need to ask them the previous number used for 2FA verification on the account. Or at least, the last 4 digits of the number used.
  2. If the customer fails to provide the number we can ask for alternate details like last 4 digits of the card added to their account if the customer is an old customer and is with us for long duration.
  3. Once we get the details from the customer raise a JIRA on the FPT board and tag Rajalekshmy.
  4. Rajalekshmy shall verify the request and give us a confirmation post which we can disable their 2FA temporarily and inform the customer.
  5. If the customer fails to provide the number/last 4 digits of the card, we can directly deny the customer instead of reaching out to Finsys.

| https://plivo.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/240374  
Customers are unable to receive 2FA verification codes | 

  1. Request the customer to use call option.
  2. Check MDR/CDR to validate if the message/ calls were delivered.
  3. If the code was not delivered, request the customer to try a different number.
  4. If the customer doesn't have other numbers. Report the issue to carrier and check with Nitin for workaround.

  1. In these scenarios, we need to Reset the Login attempts for the customer from Ryuk under Account Settings

| https://plivo.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/233205  
Customer requesting to disable 2FA|

  1. Check if the reason follows in one of the above brackets and follow the debugging accordingly.
  2. If not, deny the customers request.

| We are not disabling 2FA permanently any longer.  
  
### Email Verification for 2FA

**What is email verification for 2FA?**

If an existing customer (created more than 15 days ago) tries to enable 2FA,
they will receive an email OTP to verify that it actually is the genuine
customer. **The OTP is valid for 3 minutes.**

**Where can you check if a mail was sent?**

In Ryuk, under Account History. There's a new entry called 2 Factor
Authentication under Account details. Audit logs can be found there.

**How many attempts does a user have and can support reset the attempts
count?**  
Users can attempt email verification thrice in a day. If the verification
fails thrice, they won't be able to try again for the next 24 hours. Support
can reset this count with the option ""Reset Email 2FA Attempts"" on Ryuk.

**What to do if the customer does not have access to the mailbox for the
registered email?**  
In this case, support is to ask the customers to check internally with the
mailbox owner. In case no one has access to the registered email, the way to
go would be to first change the registered email and then they can try again.
Support to help them get their registered email id updated.

3714613249,10DLC Registration Queries,"**What is 10DLC?**

10DLC (10-digit long code) is a service offered by US carriers to explicitly
allow application-to-person (A2P) SMS traffic over long code phone numbers.
The term ""10-digit long code"" refers to standard US local phone numbers, which
are 10 digits long, including the area code. Unlike short codes, long code
numbers can be used to make and receive calls. Unlike former long-code
services, 10DLC has been designed specifically for commercial A2P messaging.

The end operators, specifically, T-Mobile encourage customers to send A2P
messages via registered traffic only as unregistered traffic is subject to
high spam filtering and blocking.

In order to send the registered traffic the customer must register their brand
under which they can register multiple campaigns containing unique use cases.
Once the campaign is approved and active, customers can link a maximum of 49
US Plivo numbers (Existing or New) to each campaign.

**Charges associated with 10DLC registration**

**Brand**|  _Registration Guidelines_ Brand Registration Charges = 4 USD [One-
Time]Brand Vetting Charges (optional)  = 40 USD [One-Time]External Vetting
costs $40 if it's successful and $5 if it fails

### Customer facing an error while registering the brand on a console.

|

  * Check the account credits and brand cap limit of the account in Ryuk > Account Settings as shown.  
If the customer has reported the error definition then, explain to the
customer accordingly. Although, the failure in the console may occur due to
insufficient balance or the Brand cap limit of the customer account.

  * Check the Plivo status page in case of any incidents.
  * In case the error is not identified and the customer is facing the issue consistently then, check the logs in OpenSearch by applying **SMS** filter and adding ""AuthID"" or ""BrandID"" in the search bar >> it will show us the logs >> if any error we can then copy the api_id and search it in another tab in OpenSearch to get more details of the error.
  * Sometimes the error occurs due to incorrect details for which the error description is displayed under the affected field, however, if the details are correct and the error still persists >> request the customer to clear browser cookies & cache and re-login to register the brand.
  * If the issue continues even after following the above scenario >> create an MPT Jira with all the details and screenshots from the console.

### A brand vetting score is not sufficient.

| We can appeal only once to increase the vetting score of the brand with
Aegis, however, it is not guaranteed that score will increase. Also, the
appeal can only be submitted within 45 days of the brand approval. Follow the
below steps before submitting an appeal.

  * Check the brand vetting score in TCR Portal > Brand > Add filter and see if it's too low based on the customer requirement
  * Check previous tickets and see if the customer has not requested the same earlier, simultaneously check Gmail for that particular brand and see if there are any previous requests.
  * In order to make an appeal, send an email to Aegis {_appeals@aegismobile.com_} and keep TCR {_support@campaignregistry.com_} in CC.
  * After an appeal is approved, check in the TCR portal if the new vetting score is updated for the campaign.

receive messages. **Help Message** \- Every campaign must have a HELP message
that indicates the response to the HELP keyword**Opt-Out Message** \- This
should include an acknowledgment of the opt-out request and confirmation that
no further messages will be sent.

  * In case the campaign rejection reason is ""_**Opt-In language required** ""_ then we can share the below samples with the customer for better understanding.
  * If all the checks have been done and the customer has provided the details to resubmit the campaign then, we can add the same in the sheet _here_ to resubmit the campaign.
  *  In case any changes are required in the Brand info then we have to create an MPT Jira > add all the details and assign it to Santanu for further processing.

**Notes** : There are specific campaigns that the carrier cannot support based
on operator regulations.

# Overview of SMS in SDKs

Customers can implement Plivo's SDK and use Plivo's API and PHLO functionality
for different _SMS use cases_ such as Send SMS/Receive SMS/Reply to Incoming
SMS/Forward Incoming SMS

Plivo provides SDK integration with different languages mentioned in our
documentation _here_. It can be integrated in two ways; API or PHLO.

For different use cases mentioned _here_, customers can use any language to
implement the same.

# Overview of SMS in PHLO

Plivo High-Level Objects (PHLO, pronounced ""flow"") is a visual workflow design
studio. It provides building blocks that let you create custom voice and SMS
applications without writing program code. Instead, you drag and drop
components onto a canvas and connect them to create custom workflows.  
---  
**Creating PHLO to Handle any Incoming messages in the external server.**|  In
order to handle the incoming messages via PHLO, customers can build a PHLO and
add their endpoint URL in the HTTP node as represented below.Using the PHLO
the customer can send custom information as per the requirement. The required
variables can be found _here_.|  
**Forward Incoming Messages**|  To forward any incoming message, you can
configure the Send Message block accordingly.The below PHLO shows forwarding
an incoming message to a US number that will contain the same message content
and source number received in the inbound message.The customer can also add
custom/static values in the From/To/Message field.|  
**Reply to an incoming message**|  The customer can use the build below PHLO
in order to respond to any incoming message.|  
**Send Outbound Message**|  To send a message using PHLO by triggering an API
request, the customer can follow the steps mentioned in the doc _here_.|  
For different SMS use cases in PHLO, the customer can refer _here_.

3720151137,CNAM (Caller-ID) Registration - SOP,"## **What is CNAM registration?**

CNAM registration is a process that allows a phone carrier to register a phone
number with the Caller ID Name (CNAM). The CNAM database is used to display
the name associated with a phone number when someone receives a call. CNAM
provisioning will be provided only for US numbers that are available with
Inteliquent AND L3 (Level-3).

Caller ID (CNAM) can be set for the number as per the customer's requirement.

## **Why do we need CNAM registration?**

This can be helpful for businesses or individuals who want to display a
specific name associated with their phone number, rather than just the phone
number itself. CNAM registration is a legitimate process that allows phone
carriers to ensure that accurate information is displayed when a call is made.

## **When do we need this?**

Whenever a customer opens a case requesting the below:

  * Add/Update CNAM for their number

  * A customer shared the CNAM while requesting for port in and wants the CNAM to be updated as well

## **Self-Service - Plivo Console:**

Self-service is enabled for CNAM and can be done directly from the console by
the customer.

Customers can map their organization's CNAM to one or all of their Plivo phone
numbers from the Plivo console.

  1. Go to the Phone Numbers page.

  2. Tick the phone numbers you're interested in providing a name for

  3. Click on the Choose Action dropdown and choose **Add CNAM**.

  * If support cannot add the fee, please check with respective support managers.

  * 1888 numbers will be available in the open inventory from now on, so there will be no additional $65 fee, and they will be treated the same as other toll-free numbers in the US and Canada.

When assigning 1800 Toll-Free numbers to customers, it is essential to adhere

applications. These numbers can be used as sender IDs, receiver IDs, or

customers or clients and enhance our business communication capabilities.
